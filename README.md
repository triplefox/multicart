Ludamix Multicart

This project clones early digital games(roughly, through about 1985) with a focus on creating "reference implementations" for study by programmer-designers. The goal is to reproduce the systems and aesthetics that define these games as they were originally created.

These reproductions aim to fill a gap in game programming guides where there is an abyss between "here is a simple game" and "now make your own," by providing a large recipe book of variations which you may build your ideas off of.

Reproducing each game one-to-one with the original implementations is not a goal of this project, as it diminishes the idea of creating variations, but similar aesthetics and the methods by which they were made will be sought out where reasonable.
